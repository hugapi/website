|Pies|
======

|PyPI version| |PyPi downloads| |Build Status| |License| |Bitdeli Badge|

The simplest (and tastiest) way to write one program that runs on both
Python 2.6+ and Python 3.

Let's eat some pies!
====================

Installing pies

::

    pip install pies

or if you prefer:

::

    easy_install pies

Overview
========

Pies is a Python2 & 3 Compatibility layer with the philosophy that all
code should be Python3 code. Starting from this viewpoint means that
when running on Python3 pies adds virtually no overhead.

Instead of providing a bunch of custom methods (leading to Python code
that looks out of place on any version) pies aims to back port as many
of the Python3 api calls, imports, and objects to Python2 - Relying on
special syntax only when absolutely necessary.

How does pies differ from six?
==============================

Pies is significantly smaller and simpler than six because it assumes
for everything possible the developer is using the Python 3 compatible
versions included with Python 2.6+, whereas six tries to maintain
compatibility with Python 2.4 - leading to many more overrides and
further into different language territory. Additionally, as stated
above, where possible pies tries to enable you to not have to change
syntax at all.

Integrating pies into your diet
===============================

Using and integrating pies into an existing Python 3+ code base (to
achieve Python 2 & 3 dual support) couldn't be simpler:

::

    from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals

    from pies.overrides import *

Then simply write standard Python3 code, and enjoy Python2 Support.

Works Unchanged (The Good)
==========================

The best part of Pies is how much Python3 code works unchanged in
Python2

Functions:

-  round
-  next
-  filter
-  map
-  zip
-  input
-  range

Types:

-  object (**str** automatically has correct behavior on all versions of
   Python)
-  chr (creates a unichr object in Python2)
-  str (creates a unicode object in Python2)
-  dict (creating a dict using dict() will give you all the special
   Python3 itemview results, but using {} will not)

Imports:

-  html
-  http
-  xmlrpc
-  \_thread
-  builtins
-  configparser
-  copyreg
-  queue
-  reprlib
-  socketserver
-  ipaddress
-  argparse
-  enum (also adds this library to Python 3.0-3.3)

Different Imports (The Bad)
===========================

Some Python3 Modules have moved around so much compared to their Python2
counterpart, that I found it necessary to create special versions of
them to obtain the Python3 naming on both environments. Since these
modules exist already in Python2 allowing them to be imported by the
Python3 module name directly is not possible. Instead, you must import
these modules from pies.

Example:

::

    from pies import pickle

Full List:

-  dbm
-  urllib
-  collections
-  functools
-  imp
-  itertools
-  pickle
-  StringIO
-  sys
-  unittest

Special Syntax (The Ugly)
=========================

Sadly, there is still special syntax that is present for corner cases.

-  PY2 - True if running on Python2
-  PY3 - True if running on Python3
-  u('text') - should replace u'text' made available for ease of porting
   code from Python2
-  itemsview(collection) - should replace collection.iteritems() where
   you do not control the collection passed in
-  valuesview(collection) - should replace collection.values() where you
   do not control the collection passed in
-  keysview(collection) - should replace collection.keys() where you do
   not control the collection passed in
-  execute() - enables Python 3 style exec statements on both
   environments.
-  integer\_types - may want to use isinstance(variable, integer\_types)
   instead of type(variable, int) as long values will not match int in
   Python2.
-  NewClass(with\_metaclass(metaclass, parent\_class)) - Should replace
   both "**metaclass** = metaclass" and "NewClass(metaclass=metaclass)"
   as a way to assign meta-classes.

What Could be Improved?
=======================

I'm pretty sure a bunch. If you run into any problems or have any ideas
please don't hesitate to file a bug, submit a pull request, or email me

Thanks and I hope you enjoy pies!
